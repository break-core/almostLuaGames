An open-source collection of games I've created with almostLua, a Lua conversion IDE for RetroStudio.

## Flex Your Country
Flex Your Country is a game created in an hour which takes advantage of the "LocaleId" property of players to display their countries. It all works in one script and has leaderboard support, a billboard gui, and more.

To setup Flex Your Country, copy the code from GameScript.aml into a script in Roblox Studio, then use almostLua to compile the script to VisualSource. Then, insert the script with the almostLua tool in RetroStudio as a Script in Workspace.
